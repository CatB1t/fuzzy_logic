# Fuzzy Logic 
Implementation from scratch for fuzzification and defuzzification functions for fuzzy logic. This is a university assignment.

# Fuzzification
The fuzzification only works on fuzzy sets functions:
- Isosceles triangle
- Right angle triangle
- Trapezoid

# Defuzzification
Implemented by “Weighted Average Method” only. This method is applicable to fuzzy sets with symmetrical output membership functions.
